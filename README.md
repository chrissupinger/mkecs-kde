# An Interactive Study of Milwaukee Crime Statistics & Kernel Density Estimation

## Purpose
This project attempts to present a more innovative method of mapping crime using kernel density estimation.  It was produced on behalf of Marquette University's Computational Social Science Lab.

## Function
Stay tuned for updates.

## Dependencies
* Python:
  * [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org)
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
  * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
  * [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
  * [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
* Other:
  * [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

## Notes
* Looking to eventually implement services such as [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to manage some of the static files needed to make some app operations "smarter"
* Looking for future implementation of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) data management once the best service can be determined

## Updates
* 12.09.18: Initial commit even though the project was already running (due to troubleshooting some logic issues and sanitizing for security risks)

## Known/Working Issues
* [ ] 12.09.18: Implementing simplified view built on top of Google Maps; alternate option to the current statistical inference service
* [ ] 12.09.18: Upload dataset to this repository following major sanitation
* [ ] 12.09.18: Troubleshooting a pesky logic issue that doesn't return parameters upon post
